## ✅ **Project Requirements – Data Engineering Phase**
The first phase of this project focuses on building the data warehouse using SQL Server, with the primary objective of consolidating sales data from multiple sources to support analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### 📌 **Objectives**
- Develop a robust data warehouse that serves as a single source of truth for sales data.
- Enable fast, reliable, and scalable access to data for analytics and reporting purposes.

#### 🔧 **Specifications**
**Data Sources:**
- Import data from two source systems—an ERP and a CRM—provided as CSV files.
**Data Quality:**
- Perform data cleansing and resolve quality issues such as duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formats prior to 
  analysis.
**Data Integration:**
- Merge the ERP and CRM datasets into a single, user-friendly dimensional model optimized for analytical queries.
Scope:
- Focus on the most recent dataset to keep the model relevant and manageable.

#### **Documentation:**
Provide clear and accessible documentation of the data model, including entity relationships, field definitions, and assumptions, to support both business stakeholders and analytical teams.

### **📈 Business Intelligence – Analytics & Reporting**
The second phase of the project focuses on Data Analytics, using SQL-based analytical solutions to uncover key business insights from the consolidated data warehouse.

### **🎯 Objective**
Develop and implement a series of SQL-based analytics to provide detailed insights into:
Customer behavior: Identify trends, segments, and engagement patterns.
Product performance: Evaluate product popularity, sales volume, and profitability.
Sales trends: Track revenue trends over time, regional performance, and sales drivers.

### **🧠 Key Deliverables**
- Insightful dashboards or summary reports highlighting KPIs relevant to business users.
- Analytical queries that power decision-making through data exploration and storytelling.
- Data visualizations (optionally built with tools like Power BI/Tableau) to communicate findings in an intuitive, interactive format.
